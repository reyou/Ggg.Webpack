We introduced a new property for your config called mode. Mode has two options:
development or production and defaults to production out of the box. Mode is
our way of providing sensible defaults optimized for either build size
(production) optimization, or build time (development) optimization.
//=============================================================================
In addition, entry, output are both defaulted. This means you don’t need a
config to get started, and with mode, you’ll see your configuration file
get incredibly small as we are doing most of the heavy lifting for you now!
